    "# Background\n",
    "\n",
    "## Top-Down Approach \n",
    "\n",
    "The coursebook is part 4 of the **Data Analytics Specialization** offered by [Algoritma](https://algorit.ma). It takes a more accessible approach compared to Algoritma's core educational products, by getting participants to overcome the \"how\" barrier first, rather than a detailed breakdown of the \"why\". \n",
    "\n",
    "This translates to an overall easier learning curve, one where the reader is prompted to write short snippets of code in frequent intervals, before being offered an explanation on the underlying theoretical frameworks. Instead of mastering the syntactic design of the Python programming language, then moving into data structures, and then the `pandas` library, and then the mathematical details in an imputation algorithm, and its code implementation; we would do the opposite: Implement the imputation, then a succinct explanation of why it works and applicational considerations (what to look out for, what are assumptions it made, when _not_ to use it etc).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Training Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "This coursebook is intended for participants who have completed the preceding courses offered in the **Data Analytics Developer Specialization**. This is the third course, **SQL and Data Visualization with Pandas**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The coursebook focuses on:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Querying from SQL Databases\n",
    "- SQL Joins\n",
    "- SQL Conditional Statements\n",
    "- Flavors and Common Operators\n",
    "- End to end data analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of this course is a Graded Asssignment section, where you are expected to apply all that you've learned on a new dataset, and attempt the given questions."

    "# Working with SQL Databases\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a great number of python modules that provide functionalities to work with databases of all variants and flavors. For a MySQL database, we may form a connection using `pymysql` or one of many other alternatives:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "import pymysql\n",
    "conn = pymysql.connect(\n",
    "    host=host,\n",
    "    port=port,\n",
    "    user=user,\n",
    "    password=password,\n",
    "    db=database)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We can then use `pd.read_sql_query()`, passing in the connection:\n",
    "```\n",
    "sales = pd.read_sql_query(\"SELECT * FROM sales\", conn)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Under the hood, `pandas` uses SQLAlchemy so any database supported by that library will work. This isn't something you need to worry about at this stage of your learning journey, but for the sake for practice, let's also see how a connection URI for a SQLite database looks like:"
