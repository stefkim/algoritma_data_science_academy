# Background {.tabset}
## Algoritma
The following coursebook is produced by the team at [Algoritma](https://algorit.ma) for its Data Science Academy workshops. The coursebook is intended for a restricted audience only, i.e. the individuals and organizations having received this coursebook directly from the training organization. It may not be reproduced, distributed, translated or adapted in any form outside these individuals and organizations without permission. 

Algoritma is a data science education center with bootcamp programs offered in:

- Bahasa Indonesia (Jakarta campus)  
- English (Singapore campus)

### Lifelong Learning Benefits
If you're an active student or an alumni member, you also qualify for all our future workshops, 100% free of charge as part of your **lifelong learning benefits**. It is a new initiative to help you gain mastery and advance your knowledge in the field of data visualization, machine learning, computer vision, natural language processing (NLP) and other sub-fields of data science. All workshops conducted by us (from 1-day to 5-day series) are available to you free-of-charge, and the benefits **never expire**. 

### Second Edition
This coursebook is initially written in 2017.

This is the second edition, written in late August 2020. Some of the code has been refactored to work with the latest major version of R, version 4.0. I would like to thank the incredible instructor team at Algoritma for their thorough input and assistance in the authoring and reviewing process.

## Libraries and Setup
We'll set-up caching for this notebook given how computationally expensive some of the code we will write can get.
```{r setup}
#knitr::opts_chunk$set(cache=TRUE)
options(scipen = 9999)
rm(list=ls())
```

You will need to use `install.packages()` to install any packages that are not already downloaded onto your machine. You then load the package into your workspace using the `library()` function:
```{r}
#install.packages("plotly")
library(ggplot2)
library(ggpubr)
library(plotly)
library(reshape2)
```

The Interactive Plotting course, unlike other modules in this Specialization, doesn't follow a linear learning-path; You'll be asked to create interactive applications, documents, and a web application throughout the span of this course.

# Interactive Visualization
As data grow in complexity and size, often times the designer is tasked with the difficult task of balancing overarching storytelling with specificity in their narrative. The designer is also tasked with striking a fine balance between coverage and details under the all-too-real constraints of static graphs and plots. 

Interactive visualization is a mean of overcoming these constraints. Quoting from the author of `superheat` Rebecca Barter, "Interactivity allows the viewer to engage with your data in ways impossible by static graphs. With an interactive plot, viewers can zoom into areas they care about, highlight data points that are relevant to them and hide the information that isn't."

More than just interactive visualization, we'll also learn in this course how to make full-fledged interactive documents, interactive dashboards, and as a bonus, how to create multi-paged PDF documents with the ideal layout of our plots.

I'll start by introducing plotly.

# Plotly
Plotly is an interactive, browser-based graphing library that helps data analysts create interactive, high-quality graphs in one of the many supported languages. 

Building on what we've learned in our last workshop, we'll learn how to add some nice enhancements and interactivity to our plots using plotly. This works entirelly locally and through the HTML widgets framework, allowing you to create interactive plots directly within RStudio. 

We'll read our data in and perform the (hopefully by now) standard preprocessing procedure:
```{r}
vids <- read.csv("youtubetrends.csv")
vids$likesratio <- vids$likes/vids$views
vids$dislikesratio <- vids$dislikes/vids$views
```

Recall that our videos can take one of the 16 possible video categories. We've primarily been working with the News and Media category in our last workshop, so for a change of scenery we'll be using the videos in the `Comedy` category for most of our examples.  
```{r}
table(vids$category_id)
```

Also recalled how we created our custom theme together in the last workshop using `theme`. Because you're studying at Algoritma, we'll save our theme as `theme_algoritma`:
```{r}
theme_algoritma <- theme(
  legend.key = element_rect(fill="black"),
  legend.background = element_rect(color="white", fill="#263238"),
  plot.subtitle = element_text(size=6, color="white"),
  panel.background = element_rect(fill="#dddddd"),
  panel.border = element_rect(fill=NA),
  panel.grid.minor.x = element_blank(),
  panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),
  panel.grid.major.y = element_line(color="darkgrey", linetype=2),
  panel.grid.minor.y = element_blank(),
  plot.background = element_rect(fill="#263238"),
  text = element_text(color="white"),
  axis.text = element_text(color="white")
)
```

Try and spend a couple of minutes on the code above and have a conceptual understanding of what each line does. This should not be too foreign to you by now! We'll apply this theme a lot in subsequent `ggplot` graphics and feel free to revisit this chunk and make any aesthetic adjustments to your liking. 

In the past, we've relied on R's base functionality for data preparation, I want to show you a technique that may greatly increase your productivity when working with R. This technique is developed as "a grammar of data manipulation", and works by providing a consistent set of "verbs" that help you solve the most common data manipulation challenges:  

- `mutate()` adds new variable  
```{r}
vids <- mutate(vids, likeability = likes/dislikes)
```

- `select()` keeps only the variables we mentioned  
```{r eval=F}
channels <- select(vids, c(channel_title, category_id))
tail(channels)
```

- `filter()` returns only the rows based on conditions
```{r}
filter(vids, views>=25000000)
```

- `summarise()` returns a summary statistics (min, length, mean etc)

Each of these verbs also work with `group_by()` which allows us to perform any operation "by group". I've attached a full copy of the `dplyr` cheatsheet in your directory. 
![](dplyr.png)

A common operation with `dplyr` is to use `group_by` and `summarise` to get a new summary dataframe. This combines nicely with any additional verbs we add to it, through a chaining (`%>%`) operator. Sounds a little abstract, so let's dive into an example:
```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
v.favor <- vids %>% 
  group_by(category_id) %>%
  summarise(likeratio = mean(likes/views), 
            dlikeratio = mean(dislikes/views)
            ) %>%
  mutate(favor = likeratio/dlikeratio)
```

We should take a look at the first few rows of the data we just created:
```{r}
v.favor %>% head()
```

Now using the `v.favor` dataframe we created and the `theme_algoritma` we wrote in our last workshop, let's build a `ggplot`:
```{r}
colp <- ggplot(v.favor, aes(x=favor, y=category_id))+
  geom_col(fill="dodgerblue4")+
  labs(title="Favorability Index by Video Category, 2018")+
  theme_algoritma
colp
```

A simple but pleasant looking bar plot. Adding interactivity using `plotly` is as simple as wrapping our `ggplot` object into the `ggplotly` function:
```{r}
ggplotly(colp)
```

As you hover your mouse over, notice the tooltip that shows you the value of our "favorability" index by each category. 

> Updated: If `ggplotly` glitches out or return an incorrect-looking plot, try and install `ggplot2` from Hadley's github repo using `devtools::install_github('hadley/ggplot2')` and restart your R session

Let's see another example of using the `dplyr` grammar. Supposed we like to create a summary table that counts the number of appearance each "Comedy" channel has made in that period of trending videos, we could have written the following:
```{r}
comedy <- vids[vids$category_id == "Comedy", ]
comedy <- aggregate(trending_date ~ channel_title, comedy, length)
comedy <- comedy[order(comedy$trending_date, decreasing=T), ]
names(comedy) <- c("channel_title", "count")
head(comedy)
```

**Quiz 1: Using `dplyr`**  

Could we have done it easier with `dplyr`? Refer back to the earlier code chunk and the cheatsheet in your folder to see if you can rewrite the code in `dplyr`. 

From this point on, I'll leave the creative decision up to you - write R whichever way you prefer! For the most part, to keep the course materials relatively beginner-friendly I'll use the base R method but where it greatly simplify things, but I may use `dplyr` in future courses and will expect you to understand them.

Now let's create a second `ggplot` object, I'll name it `hexp`:
```{r}
hexp <- ggplot(vids[vids$category_id == "Comedy",], 
               aes(x=likesratio, y=dislikesratio)) +
  geom_point(aes(size=views), alpha=0.5, show.legend = F) + 
  labs(title="Likes vs Dislikes in Trending Comedy Videos", subtitle="Visualizing likes vs dislikes in the Algoritma theme, source: YouTube") +
  theme_algoritma
hexp
```

Wrapping `hexp` in our `ggplotly()` function yields an interactive HTML widget:
```{r}
ggplotly(hexp)
```

Plotly works with time series data as well. To show you an illustration of this, I'll read the `economics` dataset that ships with ggplot. `economics_long` is a US economic time series and I'll use the first three columns of it:
```{r}
el <- as.data.frame(economics_long[,1:3])
```

Creating a `facet_grid` ggplot object with varying y-scales on each of the grid:
```{r}
econp <- ggplot(el, aes(date, value, group=variable)) + 
  geom_line()+
  facet_grid(variable ~ ., scale = "free_y")+
  labs(title="US Economic time series")+
  theme_algoritma
econp
```

Creating our `ggplotly` object to add interactivity in our plots:
```{r warning=FALSE}
ggplotly(econp)
```

Because it is a plotly object, you can also use supporting plotly functions such as `rangeslider()` to add a range slider to the x-axis.
```{r}
rangeslider(ggplotly(econp))
```

Before you proceed, drag across the range slider and see how your plot reacts to the different values on the range slider.

Now let's take it further with our plotly experimentation. First, we'll create a long format data frame containing videos that have comment enabled:

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# 4,8,7,9 pointing to category_id, likes, dislikes, comment_count
vids.m <- vids[vids$comments_disabled == F,c(4,7,8,9)]

library(tidyr)
vids.m <- pivot_longer(data = vids.m,
                       cols = -category_id,
                       names_to = "variable",
                       values_to = "value")
```

As we create our `ggplot`, then wrap it in `ggplotly()` as we've been doing above:
```{r}
cplot <- ggplot(vids.m, aes(x=value, y=category_id))+
  # position can also be stack
  geom_col(position="dodge", aes(fill=variable))
ggplotly(cplot)
```

**Quiz 2: Hands-on Plotly**
Observe the many different functionalities of plotly by playing around with the icon bar in the widget. Try and do each of the following at least once:
- Switch from "Show closest data on hover" to "Compare data on hover"  
- Toggle Spike Lines  
- Click on Legend items to toggle visibility  

As a bonus exercise, try and create your own unique `plotly` starting from the raw data (`vids`). You are free to use any subsetting and pick any plot type - but the end result have to be a plotly object created using the `ggplotly()` function. When you're done, we'll move onto the next chapter! 

# Publication and Layout Options
We'll now going to create a multi-page PDF containing all the plots we've created so far. To give our publication a consistent style, let's apply our `theme_algoritma` to the last plot we created:

```{r}
cplot <- cplot + theme_algoritma
cplot
```

Through the `ggpubr` package, we'll use the `ggarrange` to put the 4 plots we created in earlier steps together into a list. Because we specify `nrow=2`, we imagine that the resulting would be a list of 2 objects, each containing 2 rows (one for each plot):
```{r}
publicat <- ggarrange(hexp, econp, cplot, colp, nrow=2)
```

Let's take a look at the first item on our `publicat` list:
```{r}
publicat[[1]]
```

As well as the second:
```{r}
publicat[[2]]
```

Once we're happy with the result, we can use `ggexport()` and specify a file name. This will export the list as a multi-page PDF:
```{r}
ggexport(publicat, filename="publication.pdf")
```

To visualize interactively, just print `publicat` from your console or document.

Similar to `ggarrange()`, plotly allow us to put different plots together into one `plotly` object using the `subplot()` function. In this plot, there are 4 subplots, and interacting with any one of them will cause the other subplots to react accordingly to your input:
```{r eval=F}
subplot(
  cplot,
  hexp, 
  colp,
  econp,
  nrows=4)
```

To see another example, I'm going to go ahead and create 4 ggplots:
```{r}
hexp <- ggplot(vids[vids$category_id == "Comedy",], 
               aes(x=likesratio, y=dislikesratio)) +
  geom_point(aes(size=views), alpha=0.5, show.legend = F) +
  labs(title="Likes vs Dislikes in Trending Comedy Videos", subtitle="Visualizing likes vs dislikes in the Algoritma theme, source: YouTube") +
  theme_algoritma
hexp
```

```{r}
hexp2 <- ggplot(vids[vids$category_id == "Comedy",], aes(x=likesratio, y=dislikesratio))+
  geom_hex(alpha=0.6, show.legend = F)+
  labs(title="Likes vs Dislikes in Trending Comedy Videos", subtitle="Visualizing likes vs dislikes in the Algoritma theme, source: YouTube")+
  theme_algoritma
hexp2
```

```{r}
hexp3 <- ggplot(vids[vids$category_id == "Comedy",], aes(x=likesratio, y=dislikesratio))+
  geom_line(col="black", show.legend = FALSE)+
  labs(title="Likes vs Dislikes in Trending Comedy Videos", subtitle="Visualizing likes vs dislikes in the Algoritma theme, source: YouTube")+
  theme_algoritma
hexp3
```

```{r}
hexp4 <- ggplot(vids[vids$category_id == "Comedy",], aes(x=likesratio, y=dislikesratio))+
  geom_bin2d(show.legend=FALSE)+
  labs(title="Likes vs Dislikes in Trending Comedy Videos", subtitle="Visualizing likes vs dislikes in the Algoritma theme, source: YouTube")+
  theme_algoritma
hexp4
```

And use `subplot()` to arrange them together into one plotly widget with the specified widths. 
```{r}
subplot(
hexp, hexp2, hexp3, hexp4,
  nrows=2, shareX=T, shareY=T, widths=c(0.65, 0.35))
```

Notice that as we use the interactive selection tools or zoom in on any part of the plot (either plot) the other plots will refresh accordingly - a pretty neat feature considering how simple its set up is!

Note that the common title automatically takes the last plot's title, so in this case the common (shared) title inherits from `hexp4`. As of its current development cycle, plotly does not support titles or any similar functionalities yet so adding a subplot title or even a mutual title is a bit hackerish (using `annotate()`[^1]) and beyond the scope of this coursebook. As and when this change in a future release / update, I will update this coursebook accordingly to include examples.

# Flex Dashboard
Flex Dashboard is an R package that "easily create flexible, attractive, interactive dashboards with R". Authoring and customization of dashboards is done using R Markdown with the `flexdashboard::flex_dashboard` output format. To get started, install **flexdashboard** using the standard installation process you should be familiar by now:  
`install.packages(flexdashboard)`

When that is done, create a new R Markdown document from within RStudio, choose "From Template" and then **Flex Dashboard** as following:
![](flexscreen.png)

The template code that was generated for you takes some default value - for example it chooses to have a `columns` orientation and set your layout to `fill`. 

If you like your plots to change in height so as to fill the web page vertically, the `vertical_layout: fill` (default) setting should be kept. If you want the charts to maintain their original height instead, this makes it necessary to have page scrolling in order to accommodate all your plots. That can be done by setting `vertical_layout` to a scrolling layout using `scroll`. 

Within each of the code chunk of the Rmd template code that was generated for you, you will find it common to enter:  
- R graphical output (`plot()`, `ggplot()`)
- Interactive JavaScript data visualization based on htmlwidgets (`plotly`)  
- Tabular data (`table()`)  
- Common summary data, text, values etc 

# Summary
Congratulations on getting started with making interactive plots using `plotly` and `flexdashboard` - in the remaining sessions of this workshop we'll look at creating an interactive document that allow the end user to interact with our creation and we'll publish our project onto the web in the learn-by-building module. 

I hope you're starting to feel more accomplished from the earlier days when we are all learning the ropes in our first few session. As always, the secret to fluency is practice!

Happy coding! 

Samuel
